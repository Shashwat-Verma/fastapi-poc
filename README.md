FastAPI: 

 

Features: 

Asynchronous Support: FastAPI leverages asynchronous programming (ASGI) for efficient handling of concurrent requests. 

Data Validation: It provides automatic data validation and serialization based on Python type hints. 

Interactive API Documentation: FastAPI generates interactive API documentation using Swagger UI or ReDoc. 

Dependency Injection: Dependency injection simplifies handling of dependencies and middleware. 

 

Performance: 

Exceptional Performance: FastAPI's asynchronous design allows it to handle high concurrency efficiently. 

Efficient Request Handling: It outperforms Flask, especially under heavy loads. 

 

Pros: 

Type Safety: Automatic validation based on type hints. 

Interactive Docs: Built-in API documentation. 

Fast Execution: Asynchronous handling. 

 

Cons: 

Learning Curve: May be steeper due to its advanced features. 

Smaller Community: Still gaining popularity compared to Flask. 

  

 

Flask:  

 

Features: 

Lightweight: Flask is a minimalistic micro web framework. 

Extensible: Developers can add components as needed. 

Widely Adopted: Used extensively for ML and API development. 

 

Performance: 

Performant: Flask is efficient but may not match FastAPI's speed under high concurrency. 

 

Pros: 

Simplicity: Minimalistic and easy to learn. 

Flexibility: Developers can choose libraries and tools. 

Mature Ecosystem: Well-established and widely used. 

 

Cons: 

Lacks Built-in Validation: Requires additional libraries for data validation. 

Not Fully Asynchronous: Not designed for high concurrency. 

 

Conclusion: 

FastAPI excels in performance, type safety, and automatic documentation. 

Flask is simpler, widely adopted, and suitable for smaller projects. 

Choose FastAPI for high-performance APIs and Flask for straightforward, smaller-scale applications.
